## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

WELCOME! This is our github for code required to do our research. Confused about where to start? We
have some resources to help you begin!

Check out the [1-BUGOFTHEWEEK-Information](https://github.com/bugoftheweek/1-BUGOFTHEWEEK-Information) 
repository for details about this github organisation and how to navigate the site.

If you want to add a script or a repository, go [here](https://github.com/bugoftheweek/1-BUGOFTHEWEEK-Information/tree/main/Create%20a%20Repo) 
for details of repository structure and how to set up RMarkdown Files.

Go to this [Github website](https://luyiwangtw.github.io/BugoftheweekWorkshop/) to learn more about
